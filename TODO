### Small TODOs ###
- Cold effect needed for some reactions eg. level 5
- Use a logger library and allow fine tuning wanted debug messages
- Give aqueous molecules a blueish background
- Extract all level logic from Game to Level
- Don't destroy atoms during reaction, re-use them instead
- Make bonds stiffer to better match the molecule layout
- Make + and - charge atoms stick together in a easily breakable joint.

### Medium TODOs ###
- GUI to edit reactions
- GUI to edit levels
- Write adequate unittests for the game logic
- Allow zooming to enable levels with many/big molecules

### Big TODOs ###
- move to pygtk3
