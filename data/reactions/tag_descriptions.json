  "Protonation": {
    "description": "Protonation is the process of adding a proton (H\u207a) to a molecule, resulting in the formation of a positively charged species. This reaction often increases the reactivity of the molecule by altering its electron density. Protonation is common in acid-base chemistry and plays a pivotal role in many biochemical reactions. It can serve as an activation step for subsequent transformations, enabling molecules to undergo further chemical changes. The process is typically reversible, depending on the reaction conditions and the strength of the acid involved.",

  "Radical initiation": {
    "description": "Radical initiation denotes the elementary event(s) that first generate free radical species from closed\u2011shell precursors (e.g. photolysis, homolytic bond fission, redox single\u2011electron transfer). Efficient initiation establishes a baseline radical flux that drives subsequent propagation cycles. In dilute prebiotic gas mixtures it governs overall chain length, product distribution, and the balance between constructive synthesis and unproductive recombination.",

  },
  "Radical propagation": {
    "description": "Radical propagation encompasses successive radical transformations that regenerate a radical (often of a different identity) while advancing molecular complexity. Propagation steps sustain chain length, amplify small initiation events, and channel reactive intermediates toward productive products instead of termination. Kinetic efficiency and selectivity depend on collision frequency, activation barriers, and competition from recombination or disproportionation pathways.",

  },
  "Radical recombination": {
    "description": "Radical recombination (termination) couples two radicals to yield a closed\u2011shell product, removing reactive species from the medium and capping chain length. It can sequester functionality into stable molecules (e.g. methanol from CH<sub>3</sub>\u00b7 and OH\u00b7) or form diatomics (H<sub>2</sub>) that alter redox and mass balance. The diffusion\u2011controlled nature of many recombination events makes radical concentration and medium phase critical levers for steering net reaction outcomes.",

  "Rate-Determining Step": {
    "description": "The rate\u2011determining step is the slowest elementary transformation in a multistep mechanism, imposing an upper limit on overall reaction velocity. Accurate identification (via kinetic profiling, isotope effects, or reaction progress analysis) ensures optimization efforts target the true kinetic bottleneck, enabling rational improvements in throughput, selectivity, and energy efficiency.",

  "Redox reaction": {
    "description": "A redox reaction, short for reduction-oxidation reaction, is a type of chemical reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between two chemical species. One reactant undergoes oxidation, where it loses electrons, while the other undergoes reduction, where it gains electrons. The species that loses electrons is called the reducing agent, while the species that gains electrons is called the oxidizing agent. Redox reactions are essential in various biological processes, such as cellular respiration, as well as in industrial applications like batteries and corrosion prevention",

  "Reduction reaction": {
    "description": "A reduction reaction involves the gain of electrons by a chemical species, resulting in a decrease in its oxidation state. This process is often accompanied by the transfer of protons or the removal of oxygen atoms. Reduction reactions are essential in biological systems, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration, as well as in industrial processes like metal extraction and wastewater treatment. They are frequently paired with oxidation reactions to form redox reactions.",

  "Reductive Elimination": {
    "description": "Reductive elimination couples two ligands on a metal center to form a new \u03c3 bond while decreasing the metal's oxidation state and coordination number. It is pivotal for product\u2011releasing steps in cross\u2011coupling, hydrofunctionalization, carbonylation, and polymerization catalysis. High fidelity and favorable kinetics prevent accumulation of higher\u2011valent off\u2011cycle species and sustain catalytic turnover.",

  "Regeneration": {
    "description": "Regeneration restores a cyclic reagent or catalyst to its active form after consumption in intermediate steps. Effective regeneration loops reduce raw material throughput and waste formation. In ammonia-based cycles this step liberates NH\u2083 while fixing byproduct salts. Its efficiency strongly influences overall process economics and emissions.",
